*A simple implementation of paper "Constants Count: Practical Improvements to Oblivious RAM", 
*Ring ORAM proposed by Ling Ren et al., without encryption.

*Need jar package "guava-19.0.jar".

*First run class "Server" in package com.server, then run calss "Client" in package com.Client.

*The meta_buf in BucketMetadata in package com.ringoram: from 0 to Configs.REAL_BLOCK_COUNT is real block index, and from Configs.REAL_BLOCK_COUNT to (Configs.REAL_BLOCK_COUNT + Configs.Z) is block data offset in bucket_data.

*The offset in BucketMetadata:from 0 to Configs.REAL_BLOCK_COUNT is real block offset int bucket_data, and from Configs.REAL_BLOCK_COUNT to Configs.Z is dummy block offset in bucket_data.
